# fglunzip single file distribution 
Download either  [fglunzip.bat](fglunzip.bat?raw=1)(Download Linked file As...). or the [fglunzip](fglunzip?raw=1)(Download Linked file As...) shell script to your system having a Genero installation, preferably to `$FGLDIR/bin`.
If `$FGLDIR/bin` is in your `PATH` the program is compiled and exected just by running it on the command line.
The scripts were created with the [fglscriptify](https://github.com/leopatras/fglscriptify) Genero tool.
